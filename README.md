# Meteor ES6

Compile ECMAScript 6 (Harmony) to ECMAScript 5 with Google's [Traceur compiler](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler).

## Getting Started

Using [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite/), add this package to your project.

```
mrt add es6
```

Every file ending with `.next.js` will be automatically compiled (with source maps) and bundled in the Meteor application.
